# Detect Hooks in the Current Process



## How to Use

Open the Visual Studio project, compile it for both x64 and x86, and ensure the resulting object files are named bof.x64.o and bof.x86.o. Copy these files to the directory containing the .cna file, and then load the .cna file in the Script Manager in Cobalt Strike
